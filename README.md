# Tensorflow and neural networks

This repository contains some notebooks which document my efforts to learn about tensorflow generally, and neural networks in particular.

* [tf-logistic-regression.ipynb](tf-logistic-regression.ipynb) - Demonstrates 2d and 3d logistic regression in tensorflow, or, in other words, fitting a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to a binary training set with gradient descent. The three dimensional example demonstrates how the technique would generalize to an arbitrary number of input dimensions. This is related to a perceptron, but the activation function is different.
