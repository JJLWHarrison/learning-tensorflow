# Tensorflow and neural networks

This repository contains some notebooks which document my efforts to learn about tensorflow generally, and neural networks in particular.

* [tf-logisticregression.ipynb](tf-logisticegression.ipynb) - Demonstrates 1d and 2d logistic regression in tensorflow, or, in other words, fitting a single neuron to a binary training set with gradient descent. The two dimensional example demonstrates how the technique would generalize to an arbitrary number of dimensions. This is related similar to a perceptron, but the activation function is different.
